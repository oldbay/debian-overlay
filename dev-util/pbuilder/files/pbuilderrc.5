.TH "pbuilderrc" 5 "2016 March" "Debian" "pbuilder"
.SH NAME
pbuilderrc \- configuration files for personal package builder
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "/etc/pbuilderrc"
contains default values used in the
.B "pbuilder"
program invocation.
.PP
The file itself is sourced by a shell script, so
it is required that the file conforms to shell script conventions.
.PP
The environment variable
.I PBUILDER_OPERATION
contains the current operation mode of pbuilder, and can be used to do a
conditional configuration.
Possible values are \fBbuild\fR, \fBclean\fR, \fBcreate\fR, \fBdebuild\fR,
\fBdumpconfig\fR, \fBexecute\fR, \fBlogin\fR, \fBupdate\fR.

.SH "FORMAT"
.TP
.BI "APTCACHE=" "/var/cache/pbuilder/aptcache"
Specify the location that the packages downloaded by apt
should be cached.
Setting this value to "" will cause caching to be
turned off.
.TP
.BI "APTCACHEHARDLINK=" "yes"
Specify using hard links in apt cache handling.
Changing this to no will disable hard linking and will
copy the files.

It is advised to set this to
.B "no"
if you are using user-mode-linux.
.TP
.BI "APTCONFDIR=" "/etc/apt"
Configures where the apt configuration files are copied from.
By default, this value is empty,
allowing the usual configuration options
to take effect.
Setting this variable overrides other options.
.TP
.BI "ARCHITECTURE=" "`dpkg \-\-print\-architecture`"
Specify the default distribution to use.
This option only affects when doing
.B "pbuilder create"
.TP
.BI "AUTOCLEANAPTCACHE=" "yes"
Always run with
.B "\-\-autocleanaptcache"
option.
.TP
.BI "AUTO_DEBSIGN=" "yes"
When this value is set to yes,
.B pdebuild
will invoke debsign command after building.
.TP
.BI "BASETGZ=" "/var/cache/pbuilder/base.tgz"
Specifies the default location for the archived
chroot image to be created and used.
This is overridden with the option
.BR "\-\-basetgz" "."
.TP
.BI "BINDMOUNTS=" "directories-to-bind-mount"
When this value is set, pbuilder will mount these directories using
bind-mount. Do not bind-mount
.B "/"
.br
An Example:

.EX
BINDMOUNTS="/home /mnt/test"
.EE
.TP
.BI "BUILDDIR=" "/build"
The directory inside the chroot where the build happens. This will also be the
.B HOME
of the build user.

Attention! Some directories \(em such as
.B /tmp
\(em are not safe to use since they can be world-writable, and external user can
temper with the build process.
.TP
.BI "BUILDPLACE=" "/var/cache/pbuilder/build/"
The default place which the chroot is constructed.
.B pbuilder
will use the directory
.BR "$BUILDPLACE$$" "."
which means, that it will use the directory and the
PID to determine the directory to use.
This should obtain an unique directory for
concurrent runs of pbuilder in one machine.
This is not guaranteed to happen on network shared drives,
so be aware of this fact when playing with this option
on NFS shared beowulf clusters.
Change it to something like
.I "/var/cache/pbuilder/build/$HOSTNAME/"
when doing such a thing.

.B "pbuilder clean"
cleans up this directory.
.TP
.BI "BUILDRESULT=" "/var/cache/pbuilder/result/"
Specify the default directory which the build result will
be copied over to after the building.

Unlike
.B "\-\-buildresult"
command-line option.
The path is not canonicalized, so you should specify a full-path,
not a relative path.
.TP
.BI "CCACHEDIR=" "/var/cache/pbuilder/ccache"
Specifies where ccache will keep its cached compiler output.
If this is specified, ccache will be installed upon pbuilder create or
pbuilder update, /usr/lib/ccache will be prepended to the PATH,
CCACHEDIR will be bind-mounted in the chroot, and CCACHE_DIR will be
set to CCACHEDIR.  Note that files in CCACHEDIR are chowned to
BUILDUSERID (1234 by default).
.TP
.BI "BUILDRESULTUID="
.TP
.BI "BUILDRESULTGID="
Set the UID and GID of the files built as result.
They probably need to be set to numeric UID values,
so that it works the same inside the chroot and outside the
chroot.

If sudo is used, the values specified by sudo is used.
They are
.BR "SUDO_UID" ", and"
.BR "SUDO_GID" ". "
The default value is
.B "0"
.TP
.BI "BUILDSOURCEROOTCMD=" "fakeroot"
This option is used on invocation of fakeroot
for
.B "dpkg\-buildpackage"
in
.B "pdebuild"
.TP
.BI "BUILDUSERID=" "1234"
The uid to be used inside chroot.
It should ideally not collide with user-id outside the chroot,
to avoid user inside chroot having access to
processes owned by the user id outside the chroot.
.TP
.BI "BUILDUSERNAME=" "pbuilder"
The user name of the user the build will run as.
Specifying this will enable the use of fakeroot inside
pbuilder.

Note that this will require fakeroot to be installed within
the chroot, and fakeroot will automatically be installed.
And
.B "\-rfakeroot"
will be added to
.B "DEBBUILDOPTS"
.TP
.BI "COMPONENTS=" "main"
Specify the default distribution components to use.
This option is space-delimited, use quotes when listing multiple components.
This option only affects when doing
.B "pbuilder create"
or when
.B "\-\-override\-config"
is specified for
.B "pbuilder update"
option.
.TP
.BI "COMPRESSPROG=" "gzip"
Program to use for compression and decompression of the base.tgz.
The default is to use gzip, and any program that can be used for
the \-\-use\-compress\-program option of tar can be given.

If set to "pigz", compression and decompression is gzip compatible
but will use all available CPUs.
.TP
.BI "export http_proxy=" "http://your-proxy:8080/"
Defines the proxy for http connection.
.TP
.BI "export DEBIAN_BUILDARCH=" "athlon"
Uses this variable as
.BR "DEBIAN_BUILDARCH" "."
This trick can be used for other environmental variables as well.
.TP
.BI "DEBBUILDOPTS=" ""
The options given here will be passed on to
.BR dpkg\-buildpackage .
This can be useful e.g. for binary-only builds. The command-line option
.B "\-\-debbuildopts" will be appended to any contents specified here but
may also be used to reset the list of options.

The default value is to build source and binary package.
.TP
.BI "DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS=" "( '\-\-variant=buildd' '\-\-keyring' '/usr/share/keyrings/debian\-archive\-keyring.gpg' )"
When this option is set to
.B "\-\-variant=buildd"
.B "pbuilder"
will invoke
.B "$DEBOOTSTRAP"
with
.B "\-\-variant=buildd"
option, which results in debootstrap creating a minimal chroot for
buildd instead of trying to create a minimal installation chroot.
.B "\-\-keyring"
is used to specify a keyring for debootstrap.
.TP
.BI "APTKEYRINGS=" "()"
Additional keyrings to use for package verification with apt, not used for
debootstrap (use
.B "$DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS"
). Use this to add (local) signed repositories. By default the
debian-archive-keyring package inside the chroot is used.
.TP
.BI "DEBOOTSTRAP=" "debootstrap"
Use this option to switch the implementation of
debootstrap.
Known implementations of debootstrap are
.B "cdebootstrap"
and
.B "debootstrap"
.TP
.BI "export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=" "noninteractive"
Sets interactiveness of pbuilder run.
Setting this value to blank will cause the
pbuilder run to be interactive.
Change this value when noninteractive upgrades
do not work.
.TP
.BI "DISTRIBUTION=" "sid"
Specify the default distribution to use.
This option only affects when doing
.B "pbuilder create"
or when
.B "\-\-override\-config"
is specified for
.B "pbuilder update"
option.
.TP
.BI "EXTRAPACKAGES=" """ccache lintian XXX"""
Specifies extra packages which the system should install
in the chroot on
.BR "pbuilder create" "."
This is a space-delimited list.
Also this is installed on
.B "pbuilder update"
.TP
.BI "HOOKDIR=" "/usr/lib/pbuilder/hooks"
Specifies the default location for the user hooks
directory.
This is overridden with the option
.BR "\-\-hookdir" "."

If this is specified, hooks are searched for in
the chroot, when running
.BR "pbuilder" "."
If it is not defined, or is an empty string,
hooks are not executed.

For details, see
.B "pbuilder(8)"
.TP
.BI "LOGLEVEL=" "I"
Specify how much output you want from pbuilder, valid values are
.BR E
(errors only),
.BR W
(errors and warnings),
.BR I
(errors, warnings and informational) and
.BR D
(everything including some debug messages).
.TP
.BI "MIRRORSITE=" "http://www.jp.debian.org/debian"
Specify the mirror site which contains the
main Debian distribution.

Note that you cannot really use
.B "file:/"
kind of URL, because the location needs to be accessible from within
the chroot.
.TP
.BI "OTHERMIRROR=" "deb http://xxx/xxx/ ./ " "[|" " other deb lines... " "]"
The lines which is added to the sources.list, delimited with
.B "|"
Like:
.br
.B "deb http://local/mirror sid main|deb file:/usr/local/mirror ./"

The deb lines here are the ones that will appear at the top of the
.B "sources.list"
inside the chroot.
Be sure to follow the syntax rules of
.BR "sources.list" "(5)."
These lines appear at the beginning of the
constructed sources file, so this is the place to list your
.B "local"
mirror sites; apt will then use them in preference to the ones
listed in
.B "MIRRORSITE".

To make changes on mirror site effective on
.B update
.B "\-\-override\-config"
needs to be specified.
.TP
.BI "PDEBUILD_PBUILDER=" "pbuilder"
Specify what pbuilder implementation to use for pdebuild.
The currently possible values are
.B "pbuilder"
and
.B "cowbuilder"
.TP
.BI "PKGNAME_LOGFILE_EXTENSION=" "_$(dpkg \-\-print\-architecture).build"
The extension of filename used in pkgname\-logfile option.
.TP
.BI "PKGNAME_LOGFILE=" "yes"
Always run with
.B "\-\-pkgname\-logfile"
option, and create a logfile named after the package name.
.TP
.BI "PBUILDERROOTCMD=" "sudo \-E"
This option is used on invocation of
.B "pbuilder build"
in
.B "pdebuild"
.TP
.BI "PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSCMD=" "/usr/lib/pbuilder/pbuilder\-satisfydepends"
This option is used by various parts of pbuilder to satisfy
(i.e. install) the build-dependencies of a package.  There are four
implementations:

The "experimental" implementation,
"pbuilder\-satisfydepends\-experimental", which might be useful to pull
packages from experimental or from repositories with a low APT Pin
Priority.

The "aptitude" implementation, which will resolve build-dependencies
and build-conflicts with aptitude which helps dealing with complex
cases but does not support unsigned APT repositories.

The "gdebi" implementation, which will resolve build-dependencies
using gdebi tool, faster than classic implementation, and does not
require installation of a dummy package like the aptitude
implementation.

The "classic" implementation, which was the original implementation
used until 0.172.

The default is now "aptitude".
.TP
.BI "PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSOPT=" "()"
Array of flags to give to pbuilder\-satisfydepends.

.TP
.BI "ALLOWUNTRUSTED=" "no"
Allow untrusted (no key installed) and unsigned repositories.
.BI Warning:
Enabling this option may allow remote attackers to compromise the system.
Better use signed repositories and
.B "$APTKEYRINGS"
to add the key(s).

.TP
.BI "APTGETOPT=" "()"
Extra flags to give to apt\-get.

.TP
.BI "APTITUDEGETOPT=" "()"
Extra flags to give to aptitude.

.TP
.BI "DEBDELTA=" "no"
Enable use of debdelta to download the needed updated in the chroot, if
debdelta is already installed.

.TP
.BI "REMOVEPACKAGES=" "lilo"
Specify the packages to be removed on creation of
.B base.tgz
Leaving lilo in the chroot is like keeping a timebomb...
.TP
.BI "TIMEOUT_TIME=" "2h"
Sets timeout time.
Build will be stopped with SIGTERM after the set time.
.TP
.BI "USEDEVFS=" "no"
Whether to use DEVFS or not.  Has no effect on kFreeBSD, as DEVFS is always used.
.TP
.BI "USEDEVPTS=" "yes"
Specify
.B yes
when it is desired to mount
.B /dev/pts
interface. It is usually a good idea, since there
are many software which fail miserably when there is no
.B /dev/pts
being mounted.
.TP
.BI "USENETWORK=" "no"
Specify
.B yes
when you do not want to disable network access during build.
Network is not available on a Debian buildd, so you might
want to keep the default.
Disabling network access currently only works on Linux.
.TP
.BI "USERUNSHM=" "yes"
Specify
.B yes
when it is desired to mount
.B /run/shm
mount point. It is usually a good idea in order to work with software that expect shm to work.
.TP
.BI "USE_PDEBUILD_INTERNAL=" "yes"
When this option is set to
.I yes
.B "pdebuild\-internal"
implementation of
.B pdebuild
is used.
.TP
.BI "USEPROC=" "yes"
Specify
.B yes
when it is desired to mount
.B /proc
interface. It is usually a good idea, since there are many
software which fail miserably when there is no
.B /proc
being mounted.
.TP
.BI "ADDITIONAL_BUILDRESULTS="""
Array of additional files to copy out of the build area.
.TP
.BI "CONFDIR=" "/etc/pbuilder/conf_files"
.B pbuilder
copies some configuration files (like
.B /etc/hosts
or
.BR /etc/hostname )
from the host system into the chroot.  If the directory specified here
exists and contains one of the copied files (without the leading /etc) that
file will be copied from here instead of the system one.
.TP
.BI "BUILD_HOME=" "/nonexistent"
Set the what the
.B HOME
environment variable points to during the builds.  It defaults to a non-existing
directory to prevent builds from writing to HOME, which is reserved to users.
If you need a working HOME you can set it to
.B $BUILDDIR
instead.
.TP
.BI "BINNMU_MAINTAINER=" ""
Set the value of the maintainer name and email in the changelog during binNMU.
Such value is then copied to the Changed-By field of the .changes file.  Can be
set at run time with the
.B --bin-nmu-maintainer
command line option.
